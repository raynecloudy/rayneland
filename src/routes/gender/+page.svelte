<h1>what the hell is my gender?!</h1>
<sub>last updated 25th of july, 2025</sub>
<p>if you know me personally, you probably know my pronouns and gender identity change a LOT. i'm so sorry, i can only imagine the pain of trying to keep up TwT</p>
<pages>
  <div>
    <p>right now, i identify as <strong>unlabeled</strong>. this means i don't feel any personal attraction towards a specific label (such as <i>transfeminine</i> or <i>demiboy</i>).</p>

  <div>
    <p>as for gender <i>expression,</i> i identify as a <strong>femboy</strong>â€”though i'm not a boy. yes, "boy" is in the name, but the term <i>femboy</i> can be used to refer to a male or non-binary individual!</p>

<p>if you want to know my sexuality and/or romantic attraction for some reason, i'm finromantic and finsexual. this means i'm attracted to femininity, regardless of gender. this encompasses girls, feminine-leaning non-binary individuals, and femboys.</p>
